    <h1>Life of an Ant and a Spider</h1>
    <p>Behind the bush, upon the mound, <br>ants are moving without a sound. <br>Leaves are passed along the chain, <br> where ants are lined as one.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Strands of silver make its net,<br> a fly is caught in its web; <br>Now itâ€™s too late, <br>the spider comes to seal its fate.</p>
    <p>They march on to feed the queen, <br>deep below she lays unseen. <br>Workers feed the silent drones, <br>in their capsule breeding zones.</p>
    <p>The spider shoots its webs to reach, <br>across the ever-widening breach. <br>Swinging on a single thread, <br>beyond the gap, the web is spread</p>
